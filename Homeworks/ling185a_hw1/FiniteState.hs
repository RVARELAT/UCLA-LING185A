-- Some existing functions that will be useful as helpers:
--      elem :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool
--      map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
--      sum :: [Int] -> Int          (+) :: Int -> Int -> Int
--      product :: [Int] -> Int      (*) :: Int -> Int -> Int
--      or :: [Bool] -> Bool         (||) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
-- The `sum', `product' and `or' functions extend the two-at-a-time 
-- (+), (*) and (||) operations to act on lists. We can use them 
-- in combination with `map' to implement the kind of thing that's 
-- often expressed on paper with ``big sigma'' notation for summation 
-- ``big pi'' notation for products, etc.

-- This corresponds transparently to (17) on the handout. 
-- This function can only be used with automata whose symbol 
-- type has an equality function defined on it, because it 
-- calls the function `elem' which has this restriction. 
-- (The type `(Int,a,Int)' is a member of Eq iff `a' is.)
